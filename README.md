# dMedia Manager

dMedia Manager is an Open-Source platform to manage decentralized media on IPFS.

For a content creator, organizing and managing media is very important to write an article, create a landing page or even use it in a CMS. In the world of decentralized apps, we don't have any tool that allows us to manage photos, videos, and files in an easy and friendly way using IPFS. So, dMedia Manager is coming to solve this problem.
